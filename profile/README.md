Small libraries. Sharp focus.

microstack-dev is an open-source organization focused on building small,
well-defined JavaScript and TypeScript libraries with minimal APIs and zero
unnecessary dependencies.

## What we build

Projects under microstack-dev are:
- Single-purpose libraries
- TypeScript-first
- Designed to be understandable in one sitting
- Focused on correctness and long-term maintainability

We prioritize clarity and scope control over feature completeness.

## Design principles

- Minimal public APIs
- Zero dependencies by default
- ESM and CommonJS support where appropriate
- Predictable behavior
- Stability over features

If a problem requires a large or complex solution, it likely does not belong here.

## Projects

Each repository is intentionally small and versioned independently.
Libraries are expected to ship usable early releases and evolve cautiously.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, but simplicity is non-negotiable.
Please review the contributing guidelines before opening issues or pull requests.

## License

All projects under microstack-dev are released under the MIT License unless stated otherwise.
