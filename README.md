# microstack-dev

microstack-dev is a collection of small, focused JavaScript and TypeScript libraries.

Each project is designed to solve a single problem well, with a minimal public API,
zero or near-zero dependencies, and strong TypeScript support.

## Philosophy

- Small, composable libraries
- Single responsibility per package
- Minimal and explicit APIs
- Zero dependencies by default
- Stability over features
- Shipping usable v1 releases

microstack-dev intentionally avoids large, multi-purpose libraries and feature-heavy designs.

## Scope

Projects under this organization are typically:
- Utility libraries
- Developer-focused helpers
- Runtime-agnostic where possible
- Designed to be understandable in one sitting

If a library grows beyond its original scope, it should evolve via a new version
or a new package rather than accumulating features.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, but scope and simplicity matter more than feature count.
Please read CONTRIBUTING.md before opening an issue or pull request.

## License

All projects under microstack-dev use the MIT License unless stated otherwise.
